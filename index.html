        <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
        <p>So, there are 4 tabs in PushMachine:<br><br>The first one allows you to write blog posts in the markdown form, then publish them to all of your blog services with a tick
            system so you can choose which articles go where.<br><br>The next tab lets you upload videos to all of your video services e.g. YouTube and Vimeo, and it allows you to
            choose which ones you like with a tick system, like the previous tab. You can also easily set a thumbnail, title, description and tags.<br><br>The third tab can post short
            text to your social media accounts that are like that such as Twitter and Facebook, and there is a character length in place so you don't accidentally write too much.<br>
            <br>The last tab allows you to post images, videos and stories to Instagram.<br><br>And the best part? It's completely free, with no branding on posts, no advertisements and
            no hidden charges.
